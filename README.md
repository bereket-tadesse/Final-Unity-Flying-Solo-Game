This repository contains my first-ever game developed using Unity game development software and C# scripting. The game features aerial gameplay and has object designs created using Blender. Some in-game assets are imported from the Unity Asset Store, while others are my own Blender objects.


## Gameplay
In Flying Solo, players navigate through challenging obstacles and while the fuel runs out along the way to finally collect prize in the end.
